## 7. EsiPeso Ecosystem

The EsiPeso ecosystem is an integral part of the ESI blockchain network, which includes:

- **EsiPeso (EIP)**: A stablecoin pegged to the Philippine Peso, enabling local and cross-border transactions.
- **EsiCoin (EIC)**: The primary cryptocurrency within the ESI ecosystem, supporting broader DeFi applications and serving as a governance token.
- **ESI Ecosystem**: The unified ecosystem that combines both EsiCoin and EsiPeso for a cohesive digital finance experience.

## 8. Blockchain Architecture

EsiPeso operates on the EsiCoin blockchain (EIC-01), providing robust infrastructure for secure and efficient transactions. This blockchain uses a hybrid consensus mechanism, including DPoS, PoW, and PoS elements, to optimize speed, scalability, and security.

## 9. Governance Structure

As part of the ESI ecosystem, EsiPeso includes a governance model that allows users to participate in decisions on key issues. Holders of both EsiPeso and EsiCoin with at least one unit in their wallets can vote on proposals, including protocol updates, fee adjustments, and partnerships.

## 10. Unified Naming System (ESI)

To simplify the naming of the integrated EsiCoin and EsiPeso blockchain systems:

- When both EsiCoin and EsiPeso update to the same version, the unified name reflects this (e.g., ESI-02 for EIC-02 and EIP-02).
- When one blockchain updates and the other remains, the unified name reflects both versions (e.g., ESI-0102 for EIC-01 and EIP-02).

## 11. Conclusion

EsiPeso offers a reliable and accessible stablecoin solution for users in the Philippines and beyond. By pegging to the PHP and leveraging the EsiCoin blockchain, EsiPeso provides a stable, low-cost, and fast alternative for transactions, remittances, and DeFi applications. As part of the ESI ecosystem, EsiPeso contributes to a unified, user-governed digital economy.

## 12. Notes

The ESI-01 designation serves as a unified name for both the EsiCoin and EsiPeso blockchains (EIC-01 and EIP-01). It does not represent a separate blockchain but unifies both under one identifier. If updates occur, the naming will reflect the most recent version of each blockchain.
