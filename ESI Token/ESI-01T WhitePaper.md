---

## **1-1: Core Attributes**  

### **No Supply**

The **ESI Standard Token (ESI-01T)** does not have a defined supply. It functions as a foundational standard rather than a circulating asset, ensuring it is only used as a guideline for compatibility and integration across the ecosystem.  

### **Decimals**

**ESI-01T** supports 12 decimals. This precision aligns with its purpose of supporting a wide range of financial and technical applications within the **ESI Org** ecosystem.  

### **Symbol**

The symbol for the standard token is **ESI-01T**, denoting its role as the core standard for the ecosystem's blockchain infrastructure.  

### **Name**

The formal name of the token is **ESI Standard Token**.  

### **Ownership and Roles**

- **Ownership**: The **ESI Standard Token** is not owned by any individual or entity. Its purpose is to serve as a model for creating, managing, and integrating other tokens, coins, stablecoins, and sub-stablecoins.  
- **Roles**: The token does not assign roles, as it is not an operational token but a structural framework.  

### **Standard Functions**

**ESI-01T** incorporates functionalities from multiple token standards to address issues commonly found in existing cryptocurrencies, such as:  

- **High fees**: Implements mechanisms to reduce transaction costs.
- **Low security**: Ensures advanced cryptographic security measures.  
- **Slow speeds**: Enhances transaction throughput for efficient operations.  
- **Inefficiencies**: Eliminates redundancies in token operations and interactivity.  

#### **Integrated Standards**

- **ERC-20**: Token fungibility and basic transfer functions.  
- **ERC-721**: Non-fungible attributes for specific use cases, such as sub-stablecoins or NFTs.  
- **BEP-20**: Cross-chain compatibility and improved transaction speed.  
- **BEP-721**: Advanced support for non-fungible tokens.  
- **TRN-10**: Optimized token transfer efficiency.  
- **TRN-20**: Stablecoin integrations for enhanced usability.  
- **ERC-1400**: Compliance with security token regulations and application of transfer restrictions.  
- **ERC-2612**: Enables gasless approvals for transactions.

## **1-2: Compatibility**  

### **Compatibility Across the Ecosystem**

The **ESI Standard Token (ESI-01T)** is fully compatible with all tokens, coins, stablecoins, and sub-stablecoins in the ecosystem. It establishes the foundation for seamless integration and interoperability within **ESI Org**, ensuring that all assets adhere to a unified operational standard.  

---

## **1-3: Centralized Control**  

### **Centralized Oversight**

Both **ESI-01T** and **ESICT** are managed centrally by **ESI Org** to maintain the integrity and security of the ecosystem. This centralized control enables direct oversight and auditing, ensuring that the system operates within the defined parameters.  

---

## **1-4: Governance**  

### **No Governance Features**

Neither **ESI-01T** nor **ESICT** includes governance functionalities. Decisions regarding their implementation, functionality, or updates are solely managed by **ESI Org**, with no voting mechanisms or external input incorporated.  

---

## **1-5: Security and Auditing**  

### **Security Protocols**

Both **ESI-01T** and **ESICT** are equipped with advanced security measures, ensuring resilience against vulnerabilities.  

### **Auditing Practices**

Periodic audits conducted by **ESI Org** guarantee compliance with ecosystem standards and maintain the trustworthiness of these tokens.  

---

## **1-6: Minting and Distribution**  

### **Minting Process**

The minting of **ESICT** is exclusively controlled by **ESI Org**. This ensures a secure and balanced distribution, aligning with the platformâ€™s operational requirements.  

### **Distribution Protocol**

Distribution is managed to support platform activities, user engagement, and the operational sustainability of the ecosystem. **ESI-01T**, however, is not minted or distributed as it serves only as a guiding standard.  

---

## **1-7: Transaction and Gas Fees**  

### **Standardized Fees**

All transaction and gas fees are uniformly defined and controlled by **ESI Mainnet**, ensuring consistency and predictability across the ecosystem.  

### **Transparency in Fees**

All fee structures are publicly disclosed through verified channels of **ESI Org**. Users can easily access updated fee information for clarity and trust.  

---

## **1-8: Earnability**  

### **Earning Mechanisms for ESICT**

Users can earn **ESICT** through staking or by actively participating in the ecosystem's defined activities, such as contributing to governance, development, or community engagement.  

### **Non-Earnable Tokens**

**ESI-01T** is not an earnable token. Its role as a structural standard means it is neither distributed nor accessible to users directly.  

---

## **1-9: Restrictions**  

### **Non-Tradability of ESICT**

**ESICT** is strictly used for paying transaction and gas fees. It cannot be traded or converted into other tokens or fiat currencies.  

### **Role of ESI-01T**  

As a standard, **ESI-01T** is not tradable or transferable. Its existence is solely to define operational and structural principles for tokens in the ecosystem.  

---

## **1-10: Continuous Development**  

### **Ongoing Enhancements**  

**ESI Org** actively implements updates and improvements to their respective blockchains, ensuring that the ecosystem evolves in response to technological advancements and user needs.  

---

## **1-11: Scalability and Efficiency**  

### **Focus on Performance**

The **ESI-01T** standard is designed to deliver high throughput and low latency, ensuring scalable operations for all components of the **ESI Org** ecosystem.
