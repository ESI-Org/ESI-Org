# Terminologies of ESI Org

This document outlines the detailed terminologies used within the **ESI Org** ecosystem. It serves as a comprehensive reference for understanding the various components, structures, and functionalities of the ESI blockchain, including the mainnet, testnet, nodes, tokens, stablecoins, wrapped assets, and more.

## **ESI Org**

**ESI Org** is the foundational entity that drives the development, expansion, and enhancement of the **ESI** ecosystem. It encompasses a decentralized structure designed to ensure financial empowerment through the creation of stablecoins, tokens, and blockchain solutions that promote scalability, inclusivity, and security. The **ESI Org** ecosystem serves as a platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions.

## **ESI Mainnet and Testnet**

### **ESI Mainnet**

The **ESI Mainnet** is the primary blockchain that supports the ecosystem of stablecoins, tokens, and sub-blockchains developed by **ESI Org**. It serves as the foundation for all transactions, fee structures, and governance within the **ESI Org** ecosystem.

### **ESI Testnet**

The **ESI Testnet** is a simulation environment within the **ESI Org** ecosystem, designed to allow users, developers, and stakeholders to test functionality, transactions, and system interactions without the use of real assets.

## **Coins, Stable Coins, and Sub Stable Coins**

### **Coins**

#### **EsiCoin EIC**

**EsiCoin**, represented by **EIC**, is a cryptocurrency created by **ESI Org**. It is primarily used for large-scale transactions and is supported by its own blockchain, **EIC-01**.

### **Stable Coins**

#### **EsiPeso EIP**

**EsiPeso**, symbolized by **EIP**, is a stablecoin pegged to the value of the Philippine Peso. It is supported by the blockchain **EIP-01**.

#### **EsiUSD EID**

**EsiUSD**, symbolized by **EID**, is a stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar. It operates on the blockchain **EID-01**.

#### **EsiCrypto EIO**

**EsiCrypto**, symbolized by **EIO**, is a stablecoin created as part of the **ESI Org** ecosystem. It operates on the blockchain **EIO-01**.

### **Sub Stable Coins**

#### **EsiBTC EIB**

**EsiBTC**, symbolized by **EIB**, is a stablecoin that mimics the behavior of Bitcoin. It is supported by the blockchain **EIB-01**.

#### **EsiETH EIE**

**EsiETH**, symbolized by **EIE**, is a stablecoin that tracks the value of Ethereum. It operates on the blockchain **EIE-01**.

#### **EsiBTC-ETH EIBE**

**EsiBTC-ETH**, symbolized by **EIBE**, is a stablecoin that represents a combined value of Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is supported by the blockchain **EIBE-01**.

## **Tokens**

### **ESI Coin Token ESICT**

**ESI Coin Token (ESICT)** is used to pay for all fees within the **ESI Mainnet**. This includes gas fees, transaction fees, and any other fees specified in the **ESI Org** fee structure. Only the **admin** and **organization accounts** hold the authority to mint, burn, or transfer **ESICT**.

### **ESI Standard Token ESI-01T**

**ESI-01T** is the **ESI Standard Token**, a foundational token standard developed by **ESI Org**. It serves as the baseline for all tokens, coins, stablecoins, and sub-stablecoins within the **ESI Org** ecosystem.

## **ESI Org Tree**

### **ESI Org Governance**

**James Dominic Liao** is the sole member of the **ESI Org**. As the founding and only member, James oversees all operations, governance, and strategic direction within the organization. The **ESI Org** is structured to ensure effective decision-making and management under a centralized leadership model.

---

## **ESI Mainnet Architecture**

The **ESI Mainnet Architecture** defines the core structure and relationships within the **ESI Org** ecosystem. It explains how the various components, such as stablecoins, tokens, and sub-blockchains, interact and operate within the ecosystem.

### **Hierarchy**

## **Wrapped Tokens, Coins, Stablecoins, and Sub-Stablecoins**

Wrapped Tokens, Coins, Stablecoins, and Sub-Stablecoins are digital assets created in the **ESI Testnet** for the purpose of simulating real-world conditions. These assets are not tied to any real-world value and are used exclusively for testing purposes.

---

## **Sandbox Assets**

**Sandbox Assets** are simulated digital assets used exclusively within the **ESI Testnet**. These assets allow users to interact with the **ESI Org** ecosystem in a risk-free environment, mimicking the behavior of real-world tokens, coins, stablecoins, and sub-stablecoins.

## **Notes**

### **ESI Mainnet Architecture**

The **ESI Mainnet Architecture** explains the hierarchy and relationships within the **ESI Org** ecosystem. Each line represents a level of authority, with components governed by the one above. The "|" symbol separates components that work at the same level of authority.

## **Future Plans**

### **Future Plans for ESI Nodes**

The **ESI Nodes** will grow with a focus on maintaining balance across the network. New nodes will be added with the following plan:

- **Node Addition Frequency:** 2 nodes will be added annually or semi-annually (every 6 months).
- **Distribution:** The new nodes will be equally distributed among the existing categories: 1 non-token node and 1 token node.

This growth plan ensures scalability and decentralization within the **ESI Org** ecosystem.
