# **Terminologies of ESI Org**

---

## **ESI Mainnet**

The **ESI Mainnet** is the primary blockchain that supports the ecosystem of stablecoins, tokens, and sub-blockchains developed by **ESI Org**. It serves as the foundation for all transactions, fee structures, and governance within the **ESI Org** ecosystem.

---

## **Main Blockchain**

### **ESI-01**

**ESI-01** is the main blockchain within the **ESI Mainnet**. It is responsible for handling cross-blockchain transactions, data validation, and other foundational operations for the **ESI Org** network. **ESI-01** operates at the core of the **ESI Mainnet**, ensuring secure and efficient transaction processing across all sub-blockchains. Additionally, **ESI-01** serves as both a main blockchain, a token standard, and a standard token, akin to ERC-20, but with distinct differences specific to the **ESI Org** ecosystem. The term **ESI-01** may refer to the blockchain, the token standard, or the standard token depending on the context.

## **Coins, Stable Coins, and Sub Stable Coins**

---

## **Coins**

### **EsiCoin EIC**

**EsiCoin**, represented by **EIC**, is a cryptocurrency created by **ESI Org**. It is primarily used for large-scale transactions and is supported by its own blockchain, **EIC-01**.

---

## **Stable Coins**

### **EsiPeso EIP**

**EsiPeso**, symbolized by **EIP**, is a stablecoin pegged to the value of the Philippine Peso. It is supported by the blockchain **EIP-01**.

### **EsiUSD EID**

**EsiUSD**, symbolized by **EID**, is a stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar. It operates on the blockchain **EID-01**.

### **EsiCrypto EIO**

**EsiCrypto**, symbolized by **EIO**, is a stablecoin created as part of the **ESI Org** ecosystem. It operates on the blockchain **EIO-01**.

---

## **Sub Stable Coins**

### **EsiBTC EIB**

**EsiBTC**, symbolized by **EIB**, is a stablecoin that mimics the behavior of Bitcoin. It is supported by the blockchain **EIB-01**.

### **EsiETH EIE**

**EsiETH**, symbolized by **EIE**, is a stablecoin that tracks the value of Ethereum. It operates on the blockchain **EIE-01**.

### **EsiBTC-ETH EIBE**

**EsiBTC-ETH**, symbolized by **EIBE**, is a stablecoin that represents a combined value of Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is supported by the blockchain **EIBE-01**.

---

## **Tokens**

---

## **ESI Coin Token ESICT**

**ESI Coin Token (ESICT)** is used to pay for all fees within the **ESI Mainnet**. This includes gas fees, transaction fees, and any other fees specified in the **ESI Org** fee structure. Only the **admin** and **organization accounts** hold the authority to mint, burn, or transfer **ESICT**. These accounts are exempt from all fees within the **ESI Mainnet** and its sub-blockchains.

---

## **ESI-01T**

**ESI-01T** is the **ESI Standard Token**, a foundational token standard developed by **ESI Org**. It serves as the baseline for all tokens, coins, stablecoins, and sub-stablecoins within the **ESI Org** ecosystem. **ESI-01T** draws inspiration from multiple existing token standards, such as **ERC-20**, **ERC-721**, **ERC-1400**, **ERC-2612**, **BEP-20**, **BEP-721**, **TRN-10**, and **TRN-20**. However, it remains distinct in its implementation and purpose.

Core Features of **ESI-01T**:

- Inspired by various token standards to incorporate features like fungibility, non-fungibility, security compliance, and gasless approvals.
- Acts as the foundation to standardize all coins, tokens, stablecoins, and sub-stablecoins in the ecosystem.
- Does not include gas fees, transaction costs, or additional features like cross-chain functions.
- Serves purely as a structural baseline for the tokens under **ESI Org**.

### **ESI Mainnet Architecture**

This section explains the hierarchy and relationships within the **ESI Mainnet Architecture**. Each line in the architecture represents a level of authority, with each component governed by the one above. The "|" symbol indicates components that work at the same level of authority. This structure defines how the various stablecoins, blockchains, and tokens operate and interact within the **ESI Org** ecosystem.
