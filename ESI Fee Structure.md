# ESI Fee Structure

The **ESI Org** ecosystem includes various stablecoins and blockchain architectures, such as **EsiCoin (EIC)**, **EsiPeso (EIP)**, **EsiUSD (EID)**, **EsiCrypto (EIO)**, and other assets operating across the multiple sub-blockchains like **EIC-01**, **EIP-01**, **EID-01**, **EIO-01**, and others. As part of a unified framework, these tokens and their associated blockchains will follow a consistent fee structure to ensure seamless operations across the entire ecosystem.

## Unified Fee Structure for the ESI Org Ecosystem

The fee structure applies uniformly across all stablecoins and blockchains within the **ESI Org** ecosystem. Whether you're dealing with **EsiCoin**, **EsiPeso**, **EsiUSD**, **EsiCrypto**, or their associated sub-stablecoins (e.g., **EsiBtc**, **EsiEth**, **EsiBTC-ETH**), the fee structure ensures consistency, security, and fairness.

### 1. **Transfer Fees (Wallet Transfers within ESI Org Blockchain)**

- **Fixed Fee**: 0.1 EIP/EIC/EID/EIO for every wallet transfer within the respective blockchain (EIC-01, EIP-01, EID-01, EIO-01, etc.).

### 2. **Exportation Fee (Transfers from ESI Org Wallets to External Wallets)**

- **Fixed Fee**: 0.05 EIP/EIC/EID/EIO for transferring from **ESI Org** wallets to external wallets.

### 3. **Importation Fee (Transfers from External Wallets to ESI Org Wallets)**

- **Fixed Fee**: 2 EIP/EIC/EID/EIO for transferring into **ESI Org** wallets from external wallets.

### 4. **NFT/TA Listing Fees**

- **Free Listings**: Users can list NFTs/TA for free if they are created or minted within the **ESI Org** blockchain ecosystem (e.g., EIC-01, EIP-01, EID-01, EIO-01).
- **Fee for Non-Ecosystem NFTs/TA**: A 1% fee for listing NFTs/TA created outside of the ecosystem on the platform.

### 5. **Creator Royalty Fees**

- **Fixed Range for Royalties**: Users can set their royalty fee on their NFTs/TA, but the royalty fee cannot exceed 100 EIP/EIC/EID/EIO.
- **Royalty on Resale**: When a user resells their NFT/TA, the original creator receives the royalty amount as set when the NFT was minted.

### 6. **DeFi Transaction Fees**

- **Fixed Rate for Transactions**: 1% fee on all **DeFi** transactions.
- **Lending and Borrowing Fees**: 0.02% fee for lending and borrowing transactions.
- **Yield Farming Fees**: 2% fixed fee for yield farming transactions.
- **Dynamic Fees for Congestion**: Network congestion will trigger dynamic fees for transactions during times of high network demand.
- **Cross-Chain and Cross-Border Fees**: Fees apply for cross-chain and cross-border transactions, depending on the specific conditions of the transaction.

### 7. **Withdrawal Fees to Bank Accounts (via Fiat Currency)**

- **Philippines Withdrawals**: A 1:1 ratio for EIP/EIC to PHP conversion, as the **EsiPeso** is pegged to the Philippine Peso.
- **International Withdrawals**: Withdrawals outside of the Philippines will be subject to market and conversion rates, with a fixed base fee applied based on the formula (100 PHP multiplied by the conversion rate at the time of the transaction).

### 8. **Refund Processing Fee (If Applicable)**

- **User-Initiated Refund**: A 2.5% fixed fee will be charged for user-initiated refunds due to change of mind, misuse, or other user-driven reasons (excluding system errors).
- **Refund Scenario**: Users will receive 25% of the original amount in refunds for valid cases where the refund is applicable.

### 9. **Security Fees for High-Risk Transactions**

- **High-Risk Transaction Fee (Policy)**: A fixed security fee of 50% of the entire amount for transactions involving high-risk activities (e.g., large amounts of fiat or crypto). This discourages any malicious or risky activity.
- **Fiat**: 25% of the entire fiat to be exchanged.
- **Crypto**: 50% of the entire crypto amount.

### 10. **Staking and Transaction Fees**

- **Staking Fees**: Fees are applied to staking transactions to support rewards infrastructure. No withdrawals are allowed before the stake matures.
- **Staking Withdrawal Fees**: A penalty or fee for early withdrawal is applied to discourage premature unstaking.

## How This Will Work for All Tokens within the ESI Org Ecosystem

### 1. **Unified Transaction Processing**

- Whether the user is holding **EsiCoin (EIC)**, **EsiPeso (EIP)**, **EsiUSD (EID)**, **EsiCrypto (EIO)**, or any of the sub-stablecoins (e.g., **EsiBtc**, **EsiEth**, **EsiBTC-ETH**), the fee structure will be applied uniformly.
- When transferring between stablecoins (e.g., from **EsiPeso (EIP)** to **EsiCoin (EIC)** or **EsiUSD (EID)**), the fees involved (such as importation, exportation, or conversion fees) will be based on the transaction type, but the fee rates themselves remain the same.

### 2. **Cross-Blockchain Interactions**

- Although **EsiCoin**, **EsiPeso**, **EsiUSD**, **EsiCrypto**, and their associated stablecoins (e.g., **EsiBtc**, **EsiEth**, **EsiBTC-ETH**) operate on separate blockchains (e.g., **EIC-01**, **EIP-01**, **EID-01**, **EIO-01**), their shared **ESI Org** ecosystem ensures interoperability. This allows seamless transactions with a consistent fee structure, irrespective of which blockchain the asset originates from.

### 3. **Flexibility for Future Adjustments**

- While the fee structure is consistent for all tokens, there will be periodic reviews and adjustments based on market conditions, inflation rates, and the overall health of the ecosystem. For instance, fees could be adjusted dynamically based on network congestion or other economic factors, ensuring fairness for all users.
