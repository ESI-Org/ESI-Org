## **How Staking Works**

Staking involves users locking up their **EsiCoin (EIC)** for a specified period in exchange for rewards.

### **Key Features:**

- **Rewards:**  
  In exchange for staking, users receive rewards, typically in the form of additional **EsiCoin (EIC)**.
  
- **Network Security:**  
  The tokens staked by users help secure the network or support governance processes across the **EsiCoin (EIC)** blockchain.

## **How Yield Accounts Work**

Yield accounts operate similarly to savings accounts but typically offer higher interest rates in exchange for additional risk.

  Yield accounts tend to offer better returns than traditional savings accounts. These higher returns may apply to **EsiCoin (EIC)**.
  
- **Risk Exposure:**  
  The project may invest user tokens into decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols or lending platforms with higher yield opportunities and greater risk.
  
- **Commitment Periods:**  
  Users might lock their **EsiCoin (EIC)** for longer periods to earn higher yields and further incentivize holding.

## **How These Raise Funds**

### **Liquidity Pooling:**

Funds generated from staking, savings, and yield accounts can be pooled into investment opportunities such as:

- **DeFi Lending:**  
  Providing liquidity to decentralized finance platforms with opportunities for lending, yield farming, or staking pools.
  
- **Interest-Bearing Accounts:**  
  Investing in low-risk savings products, bonds, or other financial instruments to generate returns.

Revenue generated from these investments can either be reinvested into the ecosystem or used to maintain the **1:1 peg** for **EsiCoin (EIC)**.

### **Transaction Fees:**

- **Fee Generation:**  
  Each transaction made within the staking, savings, or yield platforms may incur minimal fees, contributing to the overall revenue of the ecosystem and supporting **EsiCoin (EIC)**.
